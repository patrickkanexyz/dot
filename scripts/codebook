# ----------------------------- COMMAND LINE ----------------------------------
# Arguments
# TODO Basic call should be `codebook "lang" "title" (if 2 args then run normally)
# This should create a new markdown file in the proper "lang" directory.  If
# the proper lang/ directory doesn't exist, you should make one.
#
# If only one argument is given then check if it is `build`.  This should cause
# the HTML site to be built and stored in html/site/
# 
# Any other argument should display `usage`
#
# TODO Include support for -h


# Helper Functions

# Checks that important subdirectories exist and creates them if they don't.
